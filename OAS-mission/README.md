# How to carry out a mission analysis with OpenAeroStruct?

## Background:
* OpenAeroStruct (OAS) is gaining popularity and is often advertized as a good example of a practical application that takes advantage of the strengths of OpenMDAO.
* However, the current example problems have many weaknesses. For example, the fuelburn is computed at a single design point instead of considering a mission.

## Request:
* Implement a typical mission analysis for an aircraft with OAS (e.g., see Figure 5: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Aircraft-conceptual-design-for-optimal-performance-Henderson-Martins/8afdee5745b956d9f1a9cb12c4284e004ce4a87b/figure/6)
