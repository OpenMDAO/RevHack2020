# OpenMDAO RevHack 2020

This is the shared repository for OpenMDAO RevHack 2020. 

RevHack is a reverse hackathon where the OM users propose problems to be solved in OpenMDAO and then the development team tries to solve them! 
The major goal of RevHack 2020 is speed the adoption of advanced OpenMDAO features out to the community. 

We're interested in solving just about any interesting challenge in OpenMDAO. 
We don't care what field your problem is in, as long as it has some of the following properties: 

**Pushing boundaries**: a problem where the solution will extend the capabilities of OpenMDAO by creating a new technique for using the framework. 

**Software design**: finding the best way to integrate a modular analysis into OpenMDAO or convert a non OpenMDAO analysis into an OpenMDAO component 

**Derivatives**: differentiating a tricky component with weird sparsity or speeding up the performance of your existing derivatives implementation with advanced coloring features. 

**Perforance**: identifying bottlenecks and speeding up code that is already implemented in OpenMDAO 

**Numerical stability**: Improving the robustness of a nonlinear solve or optimization so that it gets a converged answer more frequently


The event will be held from October 19th-30th 2020.
